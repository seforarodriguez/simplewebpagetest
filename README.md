With this I am compromising myself to complete a task daily, I am hoping will be some sort of review for me about everything I already know, and for those who see my profile, you can see my progress and be inspired if you do it better.

So far, I created 2 files a html and a css file. Put some information in in and I am trying to complete the first tasks

Part A:

A different background color.
A different font family.
A different font size.
A different font color.
A different line height.
A different padding value.
Each should have a border, but with rounded corners of different size (e.g. one article could have barely rounded borders, but the next one could be almost circular in shape)
